### API Rate Limiting

The application uses Yahoo Finance API which may have rate limits. If you encounter issues:

- The app includes automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Reduce the number of stocks being analyzed simultaneously
- Avoid frequent refreshes of the page

### Data Loading Issues

If stock data fails to load:

- Check your internet connection
- Verify that the selected stock tickers are valid
- Try selecting a different date range
